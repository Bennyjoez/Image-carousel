# Image Carousel
This is a web app created in React. I used plain css to style the app. This was part of an exercise by freeCodeCamp's article on seven react projects for 2023.
## Challenges faced
The main challenge was displaying the images on smaller screens. The images would shrink and become too small. 
I overcame this challenge by rotating the images on smaller screens.
